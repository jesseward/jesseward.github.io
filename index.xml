      <description>This is a plugin for the JellyFin media center that enables audio scrobbling to Last.FM as well as a metadata fetcher source.
This plug-in was migrated from the original Emby repository and has been adapted to function within the JellyFin ecosystem. This plugin cannot be distributed with Jellyfin due to a missing compatible license. I will attempt to keep this repo up-to-date and in-sync as the Jellyfin project matures.
