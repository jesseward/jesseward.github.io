      <description>Back To Basics is a mix that captures some of the house sounds that were popular and often heard in the Toronto Canada (and Guelph) area in the early 1990s. The mix is influenced heavily by US labels such as Strictly Rhythm and Murk which drove my love of the music in my early teens.</description>
